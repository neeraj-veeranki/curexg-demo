### Developer Comments

I have used vue js for the project. Used chartjs for visual representation.
Used axios for http api calls. Implemented  spinner to show when api call is made. For now i have taken history for 5 days and shown chart. Even though api returns fewer values than 5 for some currencies, the chart will be displayed according to received output. 

I hope application is made upto your expectations.
